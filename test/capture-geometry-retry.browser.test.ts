/**
 * @fileoverview A capture drawn for a bigger pane makes the client replay once.
 *
 * A visible-frame capture repaints each row at an absolute position, counting
 * up to the PANE's height and out to the PANE's width. A terminal shorter than
 * that clamps every address past its own height onto its last line, so the
 * overflow rows overwrite one another and the rows underneath are lost. A
 * narrower terminal wraps every painted row, and the wrap on the last one
 * scrolls the whole frame up by one. The client cannot see either from the
 * escape sequence, so the terminal response reports the geometry the capture
 * was taken at (`captureCols`/`captureRows`) and `selectSession` replays once
 * at the size that stuck.
 *
 * The comparison runs on a `mux-visible` response ONLY. The other two sources
 * position no rows absolutely, so a size mismatch damages neither and a replay
 * repairs neither, and the last case here pins that the expensive one is left
 * alone.
 *
 * These drive the REAL client in chromium and stub only the terminal endpoint,
 * because the mismatch itself needs two viewports to stage against live tmux.
 * Without the fix the first assertion below sees one fetch instead of two.
 *
 * Port: ephemeral
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run --config config/vitest.browser.config.ts test/capture-geometry-retry.browser.test.ts
