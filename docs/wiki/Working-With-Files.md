# Working With Files

Reading, editing, attaching, and previewing files without leaving the dashboard. Useful on
a desktop; on a phone it is the difference between reviewing an agent's work and waiting
until you get home.

## The File Viewer

A panel that browses the active session's working directory. Its header button is on by
default; if it is missing, re-enable it in **App Settings → Header & Panels**.

It renders what it can:

| Kind                     | Behaviour                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text and code            | Plain preview with Lines (line numbers) and Wrap toggles in the header. Long files are truncated in plain preview. |
| Markdown                 | Rendered by default: headings, tables, code blocks with copy buttons, images and links relative to the file (root-relative ones resolve from the workspace root, as on GitHub). Links to another heading of the same file (`[Install](#installation)`) scroll to it, with GitHub's heading names (lower-case, punctuation dropped, repeats numbered `-1`, `-2`), and never leave the page. Opened from an attachment card, where the file's folder is unknown, relative images show their alt text and relative links show as plain text. The MD pill in the header flips to source. |
| Images                   | Inline.                                                                    |
| Audio and video          | Inline with a working scrub bar, because range requests are supported.     |
| Spreadsheets (`.xlsx`)   | Read-only grid, parsed in your browser (never on the server), up to 10 MB. `.xls` and `.ods` are download only. |
| PDF and Office documents | Converted for preview when a converter is available.                       |
| Anything else            | Download.                                                                  |

Caps: 10 MB for text preview, 2 GB for raw and download (set `CODEMAN_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`
to change it, `0` for no limit — these bodies are streamed, so a large file costs a read
stream rather than server memory). Sensitive paths (`.env`, anything
matching credentials, `~/.ssh`, AWS credentials) are blocked from download, and SVG and HTML
are served as downloads rather than rendered, so they cannot execute in the page.

Closing the preview pauses and unloads any playing media. A video that keeps playing after
you close the panel means you are on an old version.

## Editing in place

Text files can be edited and saved directly in the viewer. Click the pencil in the preview
header, edit, **Save**.

The guardrails are worth knowing, because they are what makes editing safe rather than
convenient:

- **Extension allowlist**, not a blocklist. Code, docs, config, and markup are editable.
  Anything not on the list is not.
- **512 KB cap** on both read and write.
- **Edit mode never truncates.** The plain preview does truncate long files, and saving a
  truncated buffer would silently delete the rest, so the editor loads the whole file or
  refuses.
- **Optimistic concurrency.** The save carries a hash of what you started from. If the file
  changed underneath you (likely, when an agent is working in the same repo), the save is
  rejected rather than clobbering their work.
- **No file creation.** Writes go to a temporary file and are renamed over the original, and
  the open never creates. Editing in place is structural, not a rule.
- **Line endings are preserved** server-side, so editing two lines of a CRLF file does not
  produce a whole-file diff.
- **`.git/` is denied outright.** Hooks are executable code, and a corrupted index looks
  unrecoverable to someone who wanted to fix a typo.
- **Non-UTF-8 content is refused**, verified by a round-trip comparison.

## Attachments

Attachments are live references to files **outside** the session's workspace: a spec on your
desktop, a PDF in Downloads, a design document elsewhere on the machine.

Register one from the CLI:

```bash
codeman attach /path/to/spec.pdf
```

An attachment card appears in the session, and the file can be previewed inline. The
attachment gets a stable id, and browser requests use that id rather than carrying absolute
paths around.

Agents can register attachments too, by emitting a `codeman://attach?...` link in their
output. That path is **prompt-injectable by nature**, so it is force-confined to the
session's workspace: a hostile prompt cannot use it to pull arbitrary host files into the
event stream. The gate is an extension allowlist rather than a blocklist.

Document conversion for previews is globally rate limited. Without that, ten large documents
detected at once would fork ten multi-minute converter processes.

## Clicking a path

File paths in a session are links. That works in two places:

- **In the terminal**, on any absolute path an agent prints.
- **In the response viewer**, where paths are usually written as prose or in backticks. They
  render as underlined monospace links.

Clicking one opens it in the preview: images and PDFs render, video and audio play with a
working scrub bar, documents convert, text shows inline and Markdown renders. The exception is
a text or Markdown file inside the workspace clicked in the terminal: that opens in the tail
viewer instead, which follows a file that is still being written.

Paths **outside** the session's workspace work too, which matters because that is where most
of an agent's output lands: a screenshot in `/tmp`, a capture in its own scratchpad, a file in
another checkout. Those are served through the attachment routes rather than the workspace
ones, so the same rules apply as to any other attachment: secret trees are blocked, the
extension allowlist decides what can be opened, and symlinks are resolved before either check.

Outside the workspace the allowlist is images, video, audio, PDF, Office documents, and text
files, where "text" is the same list the viewer will let you edit: code, config, logs, csv,
markdown. The reasoning is that a session can already `cat` any of those, so the file suffix
was never what kept anything secret; the path guard is. Types outside the list (`.svg`,
`.bmp`) say so rather than failing silently, and `.html` previews as source rather than being
rendered, so nothing served this way can execute in the page.

Text previews are capped at the first 500 lines, fetched as a partial read, so clicking a
one-gigabyte log does not try to paint one.

Log-shaped files inside the workspace still open in the tail viewer, which follows a file as
it is written. Outside the workspace they open in the preview instead: the tail viewer runs
`tail -f`, and that is deliberately restricted to the workspace, `/var/log` and `~/logs`.

Nothing is registered until you click. Opening a file this way does not add an attachment card.

## Remote (SSH) cases

In a remote case the workspace lives on the other machine, and so do the files. Previews,
downloads, text reads and the clicked-path route all go over the same ssh connection the
session uses: one `realpath` plus `stat` probe for the file and the workspace root, then a
streamed `cat` (or a slice of it, so video seeking works). Symlinks are resolved on the host
that can resolve them, the size cap applies to the remote size before a byte is requested,
and an unreachable host answers 502 rather than pretending the file is missing. Nothing is
ever copied onto the Codeman host, and a same-named local file is never served under a
remote name.

Not available over ssh, and said so with a 400 instead of a misleading 404: editing in
place, Office previews and generated thumbnails (both need the bytes on the server's disk),
the file tree and path picker, and the tail viewer. Docker cases are unaffected, because
their workspace is bind-mounted at the same path.

## The path picker

For choosing a path rather than typing one. It appears in two places:

- **Browse** in **Add Case → Link Existing**.
- The **📁 Path** key on the mobile keyboard bar.

It browses one directory at a time and can show hidden entries on request. The current
folder is an editable field: type or paste a path and press Enter (or **Go**) to jump
straight there, and a full file path lands in its folder with that file selected. The
**Sort** control orders each listing by name or by modified time (newest first is the
quick way to the file an agent just wrote), with folders always ahead of files; the
choice is remembered per device. The picker inserts the path into your prompt
**without** pressing Enter, so nothing is submitted by accident. Its sibling **⌫ All**
key clears the unsent prompt, and never sends the agent's `/clear` command.

This is a separate file-serving surface from the viewer, with its own rules: it allowlists
your home directory, the cases directory, and anything in `CODEMAN_FILE_PICKER_ROOTS`, and
blocks sensitive trees. In multi-user mode a non-admin gets only their own user space as a
root, because per-user spaces live inside the home directory and a home-directory root would
expose everyone.

## Images into a session

Paste from the clipboard or drag and drop straight onto the terminal. The image is written
where the agent can read it and the reference is inserted into your prompt. On a phone, the
image key in the keyboard bar opens the camera or photo library.

HEIC images from an iPhone are converted to JPEG on the way in.

## Generated artifacts

When an agent produces a file the UI can show (a chart, a diagram, a document), it can
surface as an artifact attachment rather than a path you have to go and find.

## Git changes

Agents often leave work uncommitted or unpushed. Turn on **App Settings → Header & Panels →
Bottom bar → Git status** (per device, off by default) and the right of the bottom bar shows
the active session's repository: `● 3` uncommitted files, `↑ 2` commits not pushed, `⚠` merge
conflicts, `? 1` a repository git could not read, `✓` when everything is committed and pushed.

Click it for a draggable window, in the style of the File Viewer:

- **Uncommitted changes**, grouped as staged, not staged, untracked and conflicted, each with a
  status letter (`M` modified, `A` added, `D` deleted, `R` renamed, `?` new, `U` conflict).
- **Not pushed**: the commits no remote has. A branch with no upstream says so, and so does one whose
  upstream does not exist on the remote, because it was never pushed or was deleted there ("Upstream
  not on remote"), which counts every commit on no remote rather than showing a green tick.
- Files are grouped under their folders, collapsed until you click a folder (a chain of single-child
  folders is one row, and the folders you opened stay open when the list refreshes). Turn off
  **App Settings → Header & Panels → Bottom bar → Git status: group files by folder** for a flat
  list of full paths instead.
- **Click a file** to see what changed in it, as a unified diff with added and removed lines
  coloured. Staged files show index versus last commit, not-staged files show working tree
  versus index, untracked files show as all additions and deleted files as all removals.
  **Open file** jumps to the File Viewer; **Back** returns to the list. A binary file shows a
  note instead, and a diff over 400 KB is cut short.
- A session folder that holds several projects gets one collapsible section per repository
  found up to two levels down (up to **Git status: max repositories**, 12 by default; the window says
  when there are more). A repository git could not read, typically a timeout on a slow network
  share, is listed with the reason and counted as `? N` in the bottom-bar indicator, never silently
  left out; the **git timeout** setting raises how long it waits. They all start collapsed (each summary line shows its branch and
  what is outstanding), and the ones you open stay open when the window refreshes; an unrelated repository above the workspace (a dotfiles repo
  in your home folder) is ignored.

It is read-only and offline: Codeman never fetches, commits or changes the repository, so
"behind" is as of your last fetch. It is not shown for Docker or remote (SSH) sessions, and a repository at or inside a Docker case
workspace is skipped even from a local session (a container can write there, and git would run
that repository's own configuration on the host). The
data comes from `GET /api/sessions/:id/git-status` and `GET /api/sessions/:id/git-diff`
(see the [API reference](https://github.com/Ark0N/Codeman/blob/master/docs/api-reference.md)).

## Gotchas

- **The viewer follows the active session's workspace.** Switching tabs changes what you are
  browsing.
- **A save can be rejected, and that is the feature.** It means the agent edited the file
  while you were typing. Re-open, re-apply, save again.
- **Attachments live outside the workspace on purpose.** For files inside it, just use the
  viewer.
- **`.env` files are readable in the viewer if the extension policy allows the preview, but
  never downloadable.** Do not treat the viewer as a secrets boundary; treat the machine as
  the boundary.
