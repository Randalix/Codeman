/**
 * @fileoverview Wake a SLEEPING remote host from user input (user-triggered Wake-on-LAN).
 *
 * A durable remote session survives SSH drops (COD-104) and auto-reconnects
 * (COD-108), but nothing brings the HOST back: if the remote machine suspended,
 * the local tmux pane's `ssh` child stalls silently. `tmux send-keys` then
 * SUCCEEDS against a pane that will never deliver the bytes, so typed input is
 * lost with no error anywhere — the failure this module exists to close.
 *
 * Design (deliberately narrow, see docs/remote-sessions.md §Wake-on-LAN):
 *  - An EXPLICIT request wakes a host, and nothing else: user input on an
 *    established session (`handleInput`), the wake button (`ensureAwake`), or the
 *    user's own session create/attach request (`ensureHostAwake`, wired in the HTTP
 *    routes). Everything that runs on a TIMER — the auto-reconnect watcher, boot
 *    recovery, the reachability probe, session discovery — must never wake one, or
 *    a host would be re-woken ~45 s after each suspend and could never stay asleep
 *    (the "keepalive pings a sleeping host" failure already solved for a different
 *    consumer by `hufflepuff-mcp-lazy`). The create path is deliberately wired in
 *    `session-routes.ts` and NOT in the shared session service, because
 *    `cron-service.ts` builds sessions there without a user waiting on the answer.
 *  - Detection is a cheap TCP connect to the SSH port (no auth, no ssh client,
 *    a few hundred bytes — below any meaningful activity threshold), throttled
 *    per session. No SSH keepalive is added to the launch command: keepalives
 *    would move bytes into an otherwise idle connection every interval, which is
 *    exactly the "an open pipe keeps the host awake" bug the remote-side idle
 *    detector was rewritten to avoid.
 *  - While a wake is in flight, input is BUFFERED and flushed in order once the
 *    pane is reattached, so the user's first characters after a long pause are
 *    not the ones that get eaten.
 *
 * The pure decisions and the IO are separated so the decision table can be
 * unit-tested without tmux, ssh, or a real host.
 *
