/**
 * @fileoverview Reboot-restore routes: offer back the sessions a host reboot destroyed.
 *
 * The boot pass leaves a plan in `web/reboot-restore-registry` when the machine
 * plausibly rebooted. The board reads it, shows a banner, and the user decides:
 * - `GET  /api/reboot-restore`: what is on offer, ownership-scoped
 * - `POST /api/reboot-restore/restore`: rebuild some or all of it
 * - `POST /api/reboot-restore/dismiss`: drop the offer
 *
 * A click, not the heuristic, is what creates panes. The heuristic only decides
 * whether the banner appears, so a wrong yes costs a line of text the user
 * dismisses rather than N CLI processes nobody asked for.
 *
 * Rebuilding is take-then-build: entries leave the plan synchronously at the top
 * of the route, before the first `await`, and the whole route is single-flighted,
 * so a double-click or two devices cannot put two panes on one conversation.
 * Three things are re-checked at click time rather than trusted from boot: the
 * owner's privilege grant, the workspace still being on disk, and the
 * conversation not already being live because the user resumed it by hand.
 *
 * A rebuilt session comes back attached, idle and disarmed. Respawn controllers
 * and Ralph loops are deliberately not re-armed, and its terminal scrollback is
 * gone, because the pane is new. The banner says so.
